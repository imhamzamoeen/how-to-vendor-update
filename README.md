Introduction
In Laravel applications, the Carbon class provides powerful functionality for working with dates and times. Sometimes, it's necessary to extend or customize this class to add new methods or modify existing behavior. This repository explores different approaches to achieve this customization.

Routes
Extension Way
This route demonstrates extending the Carbon class directly and using the extended class in the application.

php
Copy code
Route::get('/extension-way', function (Request $request) {
    $myExtendedCarbon = new myCarbon();

    dump($myExtendedCarbon->dayOfYear());
    dump($myExtendedCarbon->myCustomMethod());
});
Bind Way
In this route, the Carbon class is retrieved from the app container and used, highlighting the difference between using the bound instance and creating a new instance directly.

php
Copy code
Route::get('/bind-way', function (Request $request) {
    $myExtendedCarbon = app(Carbon::class);

    dump($myExtendedCarbon->dayOfYear());
    dump($myExtendedCarbon->myCustomMethod());
});
Facade Way
Similar to the bind way, this route demonstrates using a facade to access the customized Carbon class.

php
Copy code
Route::get('/fascade-way', function (Request $request) {
    dump(CarbonFascade::dayOfYear());
    dump(CarbonFascade::myCustomMethod());
});
PSR-4 Autoloading
This route showcases using PSR-4 autoloading to load a custom Carbon class instead of the one from the vendor folder.

php
Copy code
Route::get('/psr-4', function (Request $request) {
    $myExtendedCarbon = (new Carbon());

    dump($myExtendedCarbon->dayOfYear());
    dump($myExtendedCarbon->myCustomMethod());
});
Classmap Autoloading
In this route, classmap autoloading is used to load a custom Carbon class, providing flexibility while ensuring that the vendor class can still be used.

php
Copy code
Route::get('/classmap', function (Request $request) {
    $myExtendedCarbon = (new Carbon());

    dump($myExtendedCarbon->dayOfYear());
    dump($myExtendedCarbon->myCustomMethod());
});
This repository serves as a reference for customizing the Carbon class in Laravel using different approaches. Feel free to explore each route and method to understand how to extend or modify the behavior of the Carbon class in your Laravel projects.
